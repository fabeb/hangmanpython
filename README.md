<h3>Hangman Game in Python [GERMAN]</h3>

This is a rather simple game of hangman in <b>German</b> (German text output & German wordlist).

If you want to, you can use your own wordlist. It must be in the same directory as the python file and must be named "wordlist.txt" (you can change this in the python code if you want to)
